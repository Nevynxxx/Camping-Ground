#Camping Ground 

# Overview
Camping ground is designed to make life easier to organise gaming events. It
will scrape information about previous games played, once given appropriate
details. 
I'm creating this based around Paizo's Organised Play, as that's where I've seen
the problem, but it should be able to be generalised out later to include other
systems.
